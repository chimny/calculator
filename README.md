# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page solution

This website was inspired by Frontend Mentor challenge [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).
However, testimonial section had been modified to a carousel in order to compress this section and I've added contact section.
